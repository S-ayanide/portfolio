Sounds like a dream isn't it! Well not for long. With the upcoming Litmus 2.0 we're excited to try out some groundbreaking features like GitOps, Enhanced Teaming, Workflow Visualization, Workflow Sequence Editing, adding custom templates and so much more. \n\nBefore starting this blog, do check out the previous blog on running Chaos Engineering Tests with LitmusChaos on Civo: [https://www.civo.com/learn/chaos-engineering-kubernetes-litmus](https://www.civo.com/learn/chaos-engineering-kubernetes-litmus)\n\nIn this blog, we’re going to explore how to use Civo’s amazingly fast managed k3s clusters to pick LitmusChaos app from the Civo Marketplace and set it up with no more than two clicks.\n\nFind the technical demo with Litmus 2.0 on Civo here:\n{% youtube yroUVeX9-Wk %}\n\n---\n\n![Civo](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fuser-images.githubusercontent.com%2F567298%2F65482853-a53bcb80-de9a-11e9-817f-60ab00ec265a.png\u0026f=1\u0026nofb=1)\n\n# **What is CIVO Cloud?**\n\nCivo is a cloud hosting platform powered by k3s which helps cloud-native developers manage and build their Kubernetes-native applications easily. The powerful k3s distribution helps you bring up a cluster in just a couple of minutes. Developers can now sign-up for [Civo’s Early Launch Access](https://www.civo.com/signup) as Civo comes out of their beta program, #KUBE100.\n\nLoaded with features and with considerable focus on simplicity, speed \u0026 value for money, Civo allows agile Kubernetes development and hosts various Open Source Cloud-Native projects in its marketplace to induce various functionalities according to your needs. \n\nOne of them is LitmusChaos which can be found in the CI/CD section of the marketplace. \n\n---\n\n![Litmus Beta](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EzaxpILVkAE7q4x?format=png\u0026name=small)\n\n# **LitmusChaos 2.0 Advanced Beta is out!**\n\nLitmus is a toolset to do cloud-native chaos engineering. Litmus provides tools to orchestrate chaos on Kubernetes to help SREs find weaknesses in their deployments. SREs use Litmus to run chaos experiments initially in the staging environment and eventually in production to find bugs, vulnerabilities. Fixing the weaknesses leads to increased resilience of the system. Litmus takes a cloud-native approach to create, manage and monitor chaos.\n\nWith the launch of Litmus Chaos 2.0 Advanced Beta, a new way of chaos engineering can be performed by the users, capturing a few high-level features. A detailed list can be found on the [release page](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus/releases)\n\n* Chaos experiments become building blocks of a ChaosWorkflow, to allow users to create a larger chaos scenario using sequential or parallel experiment execution.\n* A cross-cloud control plane has been built which can be used to \n  * Predefined workflow for easy onboarding.\n  * Construct a custom workflow from a UI interface for both parallel and sequential workflow from both public or private hub.\n  * Orchestrate chaos workflow across K8S agents(clusters) from a single control plane.\n  * Centrally visualize the chaos workflows, get chaos analytics and compare the same.\n  * Get the teaming in place for collaboration of chaos workflows.\n  * Agents can work in namespace scope or cluster scope.\n* Chaos workflow can be stored in Git\n* Chaos GitOps for highly scalable automation of chaos workflows. Chaos can now be triggered as a result of a change to an application. This integrates with other CD tools like ArgoCD and FluxCD\n* Chaos Interleaved dashboards. A step toward open observability that is interleaved with chaos incident details.\n\nLitmus itself is composed of microservices. And we made sure that by adding the above features for 2.0, seamlessly integrates the additional microservices in conjunction with the existing one. Litmus 2.0 is completely backwards compatible. No features are deprecated. The migration path is about constructing new artifacts such as ChaosWorkflows that include the current chaos experiments in use by the users.\n\n---\n\n# **Prerequisites**\n\n* A Kubernetes cluster you control. We'll take advantage of [Civo's super-fast managed k3s service](https://www.civo.com/kube100) to experiment with this quickly. If you don't yet have an account, sign up to join Civo Cloud now as it is production ready \u0026 open for business. Join Civo as its early access launch comes out on the 4th of May! \n\nAlternatively, you could also use any other Kubernetes cluster.\n\n* [`kubectl installed`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/), and the `kubeconfig` file for your cluster downloaded.\n\n![Civo](https://civo-com-assets.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/content_images/1020.blog.png?1604672061)\n\n---\n\n# **Installing Litmus 2.0 Beta on Civo**\n\nTo ensure Litmus runs perfectly in sync with your cluster, make sure you have installed Helm from the Civo marketplace along with Litmus since Litmus 2.0 is dependent on Helm for pulling the updated chaos charts.\n\nOnce you click on **Create** all you have to do is sit back and relax for 80 seconds while Civo creates the cluster at jet speed. Once installed and you can verify if litmus is up and running in your system by viewing the pods.\n\n```bash\n$kubectl get pods -n litmus\n\nNAME                                                READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE\nchaos-litmus-2-0-0-beta-frontend-7b76655b6b-s9989   1/1     Running     0          72m\nchaos-litmus-2-0-0-beta-mongo-0                     1/1     Running     0          72m\nchaos-litmus-2-0-0-beta-server-bc884dcc7-v6bwj      2/2     Running     1          72m\n```\n\nYou should be able to view the front end, server as well as mongo pod successfully running in your cluster.\n\n---\n\n# **Accessing the Litmus Control Plane**\n\nTo set up and log in to Litmus Portal expand the available services just created and copy the PORT of the frontend service.\n\n```bash\n$kubectl get svc -n litmus\n\nNAME                            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                         AGE\nlitmusportal-frontend-service   NodePort    10.43.24.252    \u003cnone\u003e        9091:31054/TCP                  81m\nchaos-litmus-2-0-0-beta-mongo   ClusterIP   10.43.223.208   \u003cnone\u003e        27017/TCP                       81m\nlitmusportal-server-service     NodePort    10.43.167.201   \u003cnone\u003e        9002:32678/TCP,9003:31672/TCP   81m\n```\n\n\u003e From this example, we can note that the frontend port is **31054** but it’s dynamic and will be different in your case.\n\nOnce you have the PORT copied in your clipboard, simply use your **NodeIP** and **PORT** in this manner `\u003cNodeIP\u003e:\u003cPORT\u003e` to access the portal. To get the NodeIP of the Civo cluster in this case, visit the UI and pick up the IP of the master node from the Nodes section.\n\n![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jvks811ahf36dwx9mzf5.png)\n\nSo in this case, since my **master node** is `212.2.240.142` and **PORT** is `31054`. I’ll be able to access the Litmus Control Plane by visiting **http://212.2.240.142:31054**\n\nYou should be able to see the Login Page of Litmus. The default credentials are\n\n```bash\nUsername: admin\nPassword: litmus\n```\n\n---\n\n# **Deploying our target application**\n\nJust like an application is incomplete without Chaos Engineering, a chaos injection is incomplete without selecting a target application to inject the chaos on. In this demo, we’ll target Nginx as the target application on which we’ll apply pod-delete to terminate the application pod and check if it's resilient enough to come back up by itself.\n\nThe hypothesis of this demo experiment is to kill the application pod of Nginx and wait to see if it spawns back up by itself. To deploy Nginx on the cluster do the following.\n\n```bash\n$kubectl create deploy nginx --image nginx\n```\n\nThis would install the Nginx deployment in the default namespace, you can also create the same in the namespace of your choice.\n\n---\n\n# **Creating the Pod Delete experiment through the Litmus Control Plane**\n\nOnce we are able to successfully launch the Control Plane we can select the respective agent that we want to use to run the Chaos on. By default, you’ll have a Self Agent connected and we’re also going to use the same to move forward in this demo.\n\nSince this is a custom workflow that involves adding pod-delete as an experiment, we’d focus on adding it as a part of the custom workflow and not a pre-defined one. We have two options for custom workflows - \n\n* Choosing from MyHub\n* Uploading a YAML\n\nWe’ve selected MyHub to ease the flow of the demo and added pod-delete from the list of generic experiments present in ChaosHub. \n\n![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0qylsf2pvlu5otsodtp6.png)\n\nOnce we’ve added the same in the workflow table we can click on the experiment to reveal the metadata which is tunable.\n\nIf you have installed the Nginx deployment in any other namespace or if you want to tune your experiment to set annotations to true, then this is the right place to do so. For our application, we just need to set the app label to `app=nginx` so that it can target the right application.\n\n![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f5mzrwawqntvrujakzss.png)\n\nPost-editing we can schedule the workflow by verifying the information in the Verify and Commit page.\n\n---\n\n# **Analysing the Workflow**\n\nPost creation our workflow would be available to us where we can see the live visualization of the chaos injection. The UI would map and visualize the steps in a sequential fashion and display all the metadata and logs along with Chaos Results of the workflow nodes.\n\n![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1hh463evyw70upfcv7rn.png)\n\nIf you want more granular control over the nodes, you can switch over to Table View to get a better view of the same. Upon workflow completion, the Chaos Result of the Chaos Engine would return the verdict of the workflow which specify the score of probe success percentage, the overall verdict of the experiment, phase, and other vital information.\n\n---\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\nThank you for reading it to the very end and trying out Litmus Beta on Civo!

Litmus provides a chaos operator, a large set of chaos experiments on its [hub](https://hub.litmuschaos.io/), detailed [documentation](https://litmusdocs-beta.netlify.app/docs/introduction), and a friendly community.\n\nIn this blog, we'll take a look at how Litmus Orchestrates Chaos Experiments and the individual components/resource breakdowns to get a perfect step by step understanding of how things happen behind the hood.\n\n---\n\n![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qatnp7x92foob8ekref5.png)\n\n## **The Basics First**\n\nLitmus takes a cloud-native approach to create, manage and monitor chaos. Litmus orchestrates Chaos using the following **Primary** Kubernetes Custom Resources:\n\n* **Chaos Experiment**: This is a low-level definition of the Chaos Experiment itself, in this CR you'd find the different chaos parameters, the libraries used to implement chaos, the permissions associated with the particular experiment as well as some Operational characteristics like if the privileged mode is enabled, the security context of your experiment, etc. The experiment tunables like the `TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION`, `LIB_IMAGE`, etc, is already set to a default value with the help of this CR. *(The default experiment parameters are pulled from the ChaosHub)*\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n* **Chaos Engine**: This user-facing CR helps in binding the *application instance* with the *ChaosExperiment*. It defines the Run Policies and also holds the status of your experiment. This CR helps you customize the experiment according to your need since it can override some of the default characteristics/tunables in your experiment CR. This CR reconciles with the Chaos Operator *(We'll get to more details about Chaos Operator soon, but for now think about it as a chaos generator that takes your tuned settings and applies the chaos)*.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n* **Chaos Result**: This resource is created by the experiment and is used to store details of the experiment run. It contains important experiment level details like the current Verdict (Awaited, Passed, Failed), the current status and the nature of the experiment results, the Chaos Engine reference, salient application/result attributes. It is also a source for metrics collection. It is updated/patched with the status of the experiment run. It is not removed as part of the default cleanup procedures to allow for extended reference.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n---\n\n## The Run Time Flow\n\nThe first and foremost step is to install Litmus, either by directly applying the Kubernetes manifest or by doing a helm install of the litmus chart. \n\n```bash\nhelm install litmuschaos  --namespace litmus ./charts/litmus-2-0-0-beta/\n```\nor\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/litmus-portal/cluster-k8s-manifest.yml\n```\n\n\u003e NOTE: Take a look at the [detailed installation instructions](https://litmusdocs-beta.netlify.app/docs/litmus-install) to have Litmus installed step by step in your system\n\n![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9ow0tixe4tlkrfag9wmd.gif)\n\nOnce Litmus has been installed in your cluster, it'd create the CRDs and the Chaos Operator as a part of the installation. Once you have the basic CRDs up and running in your cluster, you can pull your experiments from the Hub of experiments, the ChaosHub, containing 30+ experiments for you to try out. \n\nAfter successfully pulling the experiment in your cluster as CRs, the ChaosEngine has to be created which binds your application instance to the chaos experiment you just pulled. This whole time, the Chaos Operator keeps a watch at the ChaosEngine and as soon as it detects a new experiment installation it spawns up a **Chaos Runner** which is responsible for executing the Chaos Experiment with the help of **Experiment Jobs** (The Jobs are spawned by the Chaos Runner based on how you have created the Chaos Engine)\n\nThese Experiment Jobs then create the Chaos Results, which are continually updated as the experiment is being executed. The Chaos Runner listens to these results and patches them to the Chaos Engine accordingly.\n\n---\n\n![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a7y0yeixlse94vrlfldr.png)\n\n## How the Chaos Operator works\n\nNow at this point, we are already aware of Chaos Engine being one of the important Custom Resources in this project, but there's much more to it that just binding application instances. The Chaos Engine CR is what holds the crucial information of which is the target application to induce chaos on! \n\nThe Operator on the other hand is responsible for identifying whether the target application is existing on the cluster from the Chaos Engine (It does so with the help of app namespace and app label which is defined as a part of the Chaos Engine CRD). Once it gets confirmation that these applications are present on the cluster, it does a routine annotation check (Can be turned off as well, but in case you are someone worried about controlling the blast radius, do keep it enabled).\n\nNext comes validating the policies/run properties that have been constructed as a part of Chaos Engine (Default as well as when modified), the Engine is what holds the service accounts which is responsible for creating the Chaos Runner and Experiment Pods (RBAC). Role Bindings are very helpful when it comes to assessing the permissions you have given for a workflow or individual experiments. It is then followed by a validation of the experiment tunables that had been overridden on added, for example, adding a new ConfigMap to push some secret to it, Overriding the default experiment parameters, pushing instance-specific data dynamically during experiment run, etc. \n\nThe operator also takes note/validates the Chaos Runner attributes as well, it checks whether the pull policy, the set of images and arguments are correct or not, it comes really handy when you are targeting infra changes.\n\n### Job Cleanup Policy\n\nThis is a tunable property of the workflow which decides whether you want to clear all the resources used for inducing chaos in your application and revert it back to the original state, or you want to retain all the resources created and use it to export metrics in your own Analytical solutions.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nThe operator is also responsible for monitoring your application state, if this tunable is set to true then the experiment metrics are monitored. The operator ensures that these metrics are collected and enables the exporter to scrape them from the Chaos Engine.\n\nIn the future releases, Litmus won't have this tunable parameter anymore, since it won't be available anymore in the Chaos Engine the users can't use this tunable from there, instead, if they don't want to collect the metrics of their workflows they have to skip the installation of the `chaos-exporter`.\n\nApart from all the above Jobs of the Chaos Operator, it also reconciles the state of the Chaos Engine and takes certain steps based on the result of the Chaos Experiment.\n\n---\n\n![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c9hw1vy68j5zti1z0oon.png)\n\n## The Three modes of the Operator\n\nLitmus provides certain operational modes when it comes to diversifying the range of chaos operations for different personas making it suitable for use-cases of SREs, Developers, Service Owners, etc so that they can induce chaos on their specific cluster (individual or shared). \n\nThere are three modes that the Chaos Operator supports\n* *Standard*\n* *Admin*\n* *Namespaced*\n\n**Standard** - The Standard Mode is where Litmus run on a centralized namespace (typically `litmus`) and it watches for Chaos Engines created in the cluster in different namespaces. Mostly suited for SREs, DevOps Admins, etc.\n\n**Admin** - Admin mode is one of the ways the chaos orchestration is set up in Litmus, wherein all chaos resources (i.e., install time resources like the operator, Chaos Experiment CRs, Chaos Service Account and runtime resources like Chaos Engine, Chaos Runner, etc) are set up in a single admin namespace (typically, litmus). This mode typically needs a \"wider\" \u0026 \"stronger\" ClusterRole, albeit one that is still just a superset of the individual experiment permissions. In this mode, the applications in their respective namespaces are subjected to chaos while the chaos job runs elsewhere, i.e., admin namespace.\n\n**Namespaced** - This mode constraints developers to very strict environments where they are very conscious about the blast radius and the policies are set in such a way that they don't get the visibility to watch the Chaos Operators in any other namespace.\n\n---\n\n![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/58gpaa827kfnwpisgwxg.png)\n\n## Chaos Orchestration\n\nNow that you are aware of all the Chaos Resources and the primary details which make up the Chaos Experiment, its time to take a look at the main Orchestration. There are three main states of Chaos Orchestration namely\n* *Initialization*\n* *Completed*\n* *Stopped*\n\n**Initialization**\n\nOnce the operator triggers Chaos and spawns the Chaos Runner Pod, the experiment is in the Initialization phase. The Chaos Operator is instrumented with Kubernetes Finalizers which ensures to only delete the supporting chaos resources if and only if all the child resources have been exhausted/reached a logical conclusion and your experiment have been finished.\n\n**Completed**\n\nThe execution of the experiment is verified by the Chaos Runner with the help of the Chaos Result resource which then states/validates that the experiment has been completed. At this point, re-applying the Chaos Engine would repeat the same steps and the experiment would be repeated seamlessly. Depending upon your job cleanup policy the Chaos Operator might either remove or retain your experiment Pods. If you decide to remove all the Chaos Resources, the Finalizer would be removed as well.\n\n**Stopped**\n\nOnce initialized, you are having second thoughts about your experiments and want to abruptly stop it in the middle! You can actually do so by either patching the Engine state to `stop` or delete the Chaos Engine resource completely. If you have patched the Operator then it will set the Engine Status to `Stopped`. If you re-apply the experiment at this point, it'll re-trigger the experiment run. As a part of this abort operation, it forcefully deletes the Chaos Pods.\n\n---\n\n![Thanks](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fpm1.narvii.com%2F6488%2F49d7205822d2a62fab121a7c5ee3c8afe5ba8f26_hq.jpg\u0026f=1\u0026nofb=1)\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\nThat's all folks 👨‍🏫, Thank you for reading it till the end.

It provides you options to scale your application up and down based on your requirement, you get to choose how your application interacts with other applications or the real world.\n\nIn this article, we'll take a look at:\n* What is a CRD\n* How do they work\n* How you can create one!\n* How to delete CRDs\n* Examples of real-life CRDs in use within **Litmus**\n\nBy the end of this article, you'd have a thorough understanding of what are CRs, how CRDs work and how **Litmus** is also implementing them for their daily use-case.\n\n---\n\n## Resource and Custom Resource\n\nKubernetes makes it possible to provide a plethora of features like this by leveraging what is known as a **resource**. A **resource** is an endpoint in k8s API that allows you to store an API object of any kind. But what if developers need a custom object or resource based on their specific requirements? This is where a **Custom Resource** comes into the picture. \n\nAs a part of the Kubernetes 1.7 release, they introduced the concept of Custom Resources to extend the capabilities by adding any kind of API object useful for your application. **Custom Resource Definition(CRD)** is what you use to define a Custom Resource. This is a powerful way to extend Kubernetes capabilities beyond the default installation.\n\n---\n\n![image](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bsgo5rcqgfnj3whiqafi.png) \n\n## How does a Custom Resource Work?\n\nAs mentioned above, pretty much everything we create in Kubernetes is a resource. A Pod, a Service, a Deployment or a Secret, it's all at its very basic form a resource. These resources are often monitored by **Controllers** that are responsible for taking the information in the resource and turning it into something useful.\n\nLet's take the example of what happens when you create a Pod resource. Whenever you modify the Pod resource i.e you add, change or update the resource, there is a **controller** that gets notified about the change. Whenever the controller sees a Pod resource being added or updated, it looks up the information in the resource and then takes a decision on what to do next. In the case of a new Pod, it'll figure out what node is responsible for running the workload and assign it to that node. This assignment is then picked up by another controller on that node, which in turn makes sure to spin up the required containers.\n\nCustom resources are defined using the custom resource definition and that's why the abbreviation CRD and not CR. Once CRD is created, the Kubernetes API server creates a RESTful path to each version specified in the CRD. Based on the scope defined on the CRD file, the path may either be accessible globally by the entire cluster or only to a specific project. A CR, once defined by CRD, is then stored in **etcd** cluster. Kubernetes API server takes care of the resource lifecycle and replication. It acts similar to the native resources and when a project is deleted, all the custom resources and native resources get deleted as well.\n\n---\n\n![image](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pi8g9erib0q895ek1lr1.png) \n\n## Creating a CRD\n\nAs a pre-requisite, you'd need Kubernetes 1.7 or above and a kubectl tool installed to be able to create CRDs. Just like a lot of other files in the Kubernetes world CRDs can also be created with the help of YAML files. A CRD YAML file consists of several fields, some of the important once are listed down:\n\n* **metadata.name**: Name of the CRD that you're creating\n* **spec.group**: Name of the group the CRD object belongs to.\n* **spec.versions**: It holds the different versions of custom resources that will be created.\n* **spec.names**: Used to define how to describe your Custom Resource. You can add plural, singular and short names of your CR here which can later be handy while managing it through kubectl.\n* **spec.names.kind**: Defines the kind of CR that can be created using the CRD. Like **Deployment**,**CronJob**,**CronTab**.\n* **spec.scope**: Defines what is the scope of the CR. It can either be set to 'clustered' or 'namespaced'. It is set to 'namespaced' by default.\n\nThe manifest below shows an example CRD `ourcrd.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1\nkind: CustomResourceDefinition\nmetadata:\n  name: crdname.demo.example.com\nspec:\n  scope: Namespaced\n  group: demos.example.com\n  names:\n    kind: Foo\n    singular: crdname\n    plural: crdnames\n    shortNames:\n    - cn\n  versions:\n    - name: v1\n      served: true\n      storage: true\n      schema:\n        openAPIV3Schema:\n          type: object\n          description: \"A foo object\"\n          properties:\n            spec:\n              type: object\n              properties:\n                value1:\n                  type: string\n                  default: \"Default value\"\n                value2:\n                  type: integer\n```\n\nWe can create the above CRD simply using\n```bash\nkubectl create -f ourcrd.yaml\n```\n\nAfter creating the CRD through kubectl, the endpoint URL is generated that can be used to create and manage custom objects. This endpoint might take a couple of seconds to get created.\n\nYou might have this question, \"Okay! That cool, but how/where would I possibly use this?\", well, here is an example of how you can use it.\n\nLet's create a manifest using the kind we created with the CRD. For example, we have `my-kind.yaml`\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: \"demo.example.com/v1\"\nkind: Foo [The same kind we declared in the CRD]\nmetadata:\n  name: demo-app\nspec:\n  value1: \"Hello Developers\"\n  value2: 92\n```\n\nHere we are using the same kind we defined in our CRD, we then define the fields we want our kind object to have. Like in this example, we gave the fields as value1 and value2(As provided in the CRD) for our app. In real examples, these fields would be something like *image*, *URI*, etc.\n\nNow if we run `kubectl create -f my-kind.yaml` our application can consume the data we created with the manifest above. To see what is going on we can run `kubectl get cn -o yaml`, we can see detailed info on what we just created. \n\n\u003e cn is the short name we gave to our CRD above\n\n---\n\n## Deleting a CRD\n\nTo delete the CRD and resources we created, simply run kubectl delete just like with any other resources. When you delete the CRD, the server uninstalls the RESTful endpoint that was created with the CRD. With the deletion of a CRD, all the custom resources created using it are also deleted and cannot be retrieved.\n\n---\n\n![image](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cyq6npd5ktnv0nzp7so4.png) \n\n## Real Life example of CRDs\n\nIn this last section of our journey let's actually take a look at how real projects utilize these concepts to expand upon their requirements and actually implement them.\n\nI'm going to take the example of Litmus as the project whose CRDs we are going to look into.\n\n![Litmus](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jU91rNXg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9a1qur50nxb8hlp8w0nk.png)\n\nLitmus is a framework for practising chaos engineering in [cloud-native environments](https://dev.to/umamukkara/chaos-engineering-for-cloud-native-systems-2fjn). Litmus provides a chaos operator, a large set of chaos experiments on its [hub](https://hub.litmuschaos.io/), detailed [documentation](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/), and a friendly [community](https://litmuschaos.io/). Litmus is very easy to use; you can also set up a very [quick demo environment](https://dev.to/uditgaurav/get-started-with-litmuschaos-in-minutes-4ke1) to install and run Litmus experiments.\n\nFew of the important CRDs in Litmus are as follows:\n\n* ChaosEngine\n* ChaosExperiment\n* ChaosResult\n\n**ChaosEngine**: ChaosEngine CR is created for a given application and is tagged with appLabel. This CR ties one or more ChaosExperiments to an application.\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: CustomResourceDefinition\nmetadata:\n  name: chaosengines.litmuschaos.io\nspec:\n  group: litmuschaos.io\n  names:\n    kind: ChaosEngine\n    listKind: ChaosEngineList\n    plural: chaosengines\n    singular: chaosengine\n  scope: Namespaced\n  validation:\n    openAPIV3Schema:\n      properties:\n        apiVersion:\n          description: 'APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation\n            of an object.

You can of course extend these and play around to create something out of your own. We welcome everyone to comment and let us know about what/how we can improve these configurations to achieve more! Every suggestion is appreciated.\n\nA custom resource definition adds to the incredible features Kubernetes already offers to its users. CRD helps extend Kubernetes’ features helps make it an even more universal tool for container orchestration. You can use custom resources to add your own resources that help with your specific requirements. And, you can use these resources like any native Kubernetes service and leverage all the features Kubernetes has to offer like security, RBAC, API services, and CLI. You can also use dynamic registration to have the custom resources appear and disappear while the cluster is running.\n\n![image](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n0l4sshdm3c4w51vpvqe.png) \n\nAre you an [SRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering) or a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) enthusiast?

Chaos Engineering is not so different, its even more fun. It allows you to break stuff but in production. \n\nWhile the idea might not sound too great at the beginning because of the risks involved you might say, but stick around just a little longer and I'll show you just how interesting it can be without harming your production environment at all.\n\n![Chaos Engineering](https://harness.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Webinar-Illustration-IntroToChaosEng-1200x455-Header-OnBlack.png)\n\n## **What is Chaos Engineering**\n\nChaos Engineering is a disciplined approach to identifying failures before they become outages. By proactively testing how a system responds under stress, you can identify and fix failures before they end up in the news.\n\nYou are literally breaking things on purpose here to check the resilience of your applications. Just as scientists conduct experiments to study physical and social phenomena, Chaos Engineering uses experiments to learn about a particular system.\n\n---\n\n![What's in it for me](https://writetarget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/175_Confusion_tjwaldorf_com-1.jpg)\n\n## **Why should you be interested!**\n\nHas it ever happened to you that you have been called out of bed because the application you work on wasn’t working anymore? Or have you spent time on a Saturday doing manual failover tests? If yes then you probably are enthusiastic to learn how to avoid this.\n\nCompanies might use up a lot of recourse in hosting and managing their microservice and distributed cloud architectures, have you ever imagined what would happen if these systems which we depend upon fails? These failures not only cause costly outages for companies but also hurt customers trying to shop, transact business, and get work done. A single hour of downtime costs companies thousands of dollars thus companies can't afford to let this slide.\n\nCompanies need a solution to this challenge—waiting for the next costly outage is not an option. To meet the challenge head on, more and more companies are turning to Chaos Engineering.\n\n---\n\n![Chaos](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT21dQkg08P2D5m7qbkBnM4engPFKwYjUtClQ\u0026usqp=CAU)\n\n## **It is not an alternative to your regular testing**\n\nChaos Engineering should not be misunderstood as a replacing for either unit or end-to-end testing that you are already doing. It can rather be considered as an extra reliability and resilience testing that you are adding in your arsenal and by no means can they be simulated through either unit or e2e tests.\n\nWhen you want to explore the many ways a complex system can misbehave, injecting communication failures like latency and errors is one good approach. But we also want to explore things like a large increase in traffic, race conditions, byzantine failures, and unplanned or uncommon combinations of messages. At the end of the day we wouldn't want an unhappy customer.\n\n---\n\n![Misconceptions](https://ielts-teaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/misconceptions.jpg)\n\n## **Misconceptions about Chaos Engineering**\n\n* **We can only do Chaos Engineering in production**\n\nThis is simply a myth and you can of-course do chaos injection locally as well. Although Chaos Engineering is often executed in production this is probably not the place to start. If you want to do your first experiments it might be possible to do this in an acceptance or test environment. But for certain cases like if you want to test larger parts of your application landscape, production is the only place you can do this because it is often impossible to emulate a fully distributed application landscape in a test or acceptance environment.\n\n* **Chaos Engineering is only for large distributed system**\n\nThis is not true, you can run chaos engineering on even the tiniest of application to the largest of systems. Even a small attack/blocking a part of the system like an API call or intentionally disrupting the network of a system might be good enough to check the resilience of a small system, you don't even need to know the source code for this. Although its application shines brighter in a large system but this claim is false that you can't use it for smaller systems.\n\n* **Chaos Engineering is tethered to a certain type of technology only**\n\nNope. It's not just for the cool kids. Your monolith can use Chaos Engineering. You might have mostly seen the term Chaos Engineering and Microservice architecture interlinked in a lot of places but you can of-course use it in any sort of architecture you want. That legacy system you have can also benefit from Chaos Engineering.\n\n---\n\n![Tools to help](https://elearningindustry.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/7-online-communication-tools-that-can-help-you-collaborate-in-your-elearning-teams-e1494504296770.jpeg)\n\n## **Awesome tools to help you start exploring**\n\n1. **[Chaos Monkey](https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/)** is the original chaos engineering tool created at Netflix. It’s still being maintained and is currently integrated into Spinnaker which is Netflix’s CICD tool.\n\n2. **[Litmus](https://litmuschaos.io/)** is a toolset to do cloud-native chaos engineering by MayaData. Litmus provides tools to orchestrate chaos on Kubernetes along with a closely scope UI which has lots of features to get you started.\n\n3. **[Gremlin](https://www.gremlin.com/)** is a company started by some of Netflix’s and Amazon’s Chaos Engineers who productized Chaos as a Service (CaaS). Gremlin is a paid service that gives you a CLI, agent and website that will help you set up chaos experiments.\n\n4. **[Chaos Mesh](https://chaos-mesh.org/)** is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) hosted project. It is a cloud-native Chaos Engineering platform that orchestrates chaos on Kubernetes environments with an amazing Chaos Dashboard for managing, designing, monitoring Chaos Experiments\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n\u003e“Chaos Engineering doesn’t cause problems, it just reveals them” – Nora Jones\n\nWith that said all I'd like to mention is that Chaos Engineering is a tool to make your job easier. By proactively testing and validating your system’s failure modes you will reduce your operational burden, increase your availability, and sleep better at night. So go ahead and give it a try if you haven't already. \n\nDon't forget to share these resources with someone who you think might benefit from these.

For example:-\n\n**Regular URL:** `http://someurl.com`\n**WebScoket URL:** `ws://someurl.com`\n\n---\n\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-images-1.medium.com%2Fmax%2F1200%2F1*0w3tMXm7jr174bqOprcdOg.png\u0026f=1\u0026nofb=1\" width=\"1000\"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n## What about `wss`?\n\nJust like an HTTPS is more secure than any HTTP request! `wss` is an encrypted protocol just like HTTPS but for WebSockets.\n\n**wss** is not only encrypted but also much more reliable. That’s because `ws://` data is not encrypted, visible for any intermediary. Old proxy servers do not know about WebSocket, they may see “strange” headers and abort the connection.\n\nOn the other hand, `wss://` is WebSocket over **TLS**, (same as HTTPS is HTTP over TLS), the transport security layer encrypts the data at sender and decrypts at the receiver. So data packets are passed encrypted through proxies. They can’t see what’s inside and let them through.\n\n---\n\n## What is a GraphQL Subscription!\n\nLike queries, Subscriptions are a way to fetch data. Unlike queries, subscriptions maintain an active connection to your GraphQL server via WebSocket. This enables your server to push updates to the subscription's result over time.\n\nThey are very useful to notify the client about any updates to the real-time requests. If the back-end data changes at any point, the client will immediately get notified through the already active server connection.\n\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fjivimberg.io%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2018-10-24%2FSubscriptionFlow.png\u0026f=1\u0026nofb=1\" width=\"1000\"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n---\n\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asapdevelopers.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F07%2FApolloGraphQL-1024x342.png\u0026f=1\u0026nofb=1\" width=\"1000\"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n## Where does Apollo Client come into the picture\n\nThe **Apollo Client** is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that enables you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL. It can be used to fetch, cache, and modify application data, all while automatically updating your UI.\n\nThe core `@apollo/client` library provides built-in integration with React, and the larger Apollo community maintains integrations for other popular view layers. Thus it comes in handy for developers looking to manage GraphQL data in the Front-End.\n\n### Defining a Subscriber\n\nA Subscriber has to be defined both on the server as well as the client-side. However, in this blog, we are specifically going to talk about handling subscriber in the client-side since server-side subscriber configuration could vary based on your project requirements. \n\nYou could set up a subscriber server using goLang, Node JS, etc but the client-side handling would pretty much remain the same for different tools, libraries and frameworks.\n\n---\n\nIn this blog, I'm going to discuss how to handle client-side subscription with Apollo using reference from an Open Source Project called [LitmusChaos](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus).\n\n![Litmus](https://i.ibb.co/R4xR644/Image-from-i-OS.jpg)\n\n[**Litmus**](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus) is a toolset to do cloud-native chaos engineering. Litmus provides tools to orchestrate chaos on Kubernetes to help developers and SREs find weaknesses in their application deployments. Litmus can be used to run chaos experiments initially in the staging environment and eventually in production to find bugs, vulnerabilities.\n\nThe project is under active development as a [Sandbox project with CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/).\n\n## Our Subscriber Definition\n\nSince [Litmus](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus) is a project where we deal with a lot of Chaos Experiments and Workflow Data, we have set up our Subscriber such that we listen to the Workflow Events and retrieve a number of essential parameters which are required to plot Analytics Graph, Workflow Representation Data and so on.\n\n```bash\nconst WORKFLOW_EVENTS = gql`\n  subscription workflowEvents($projectID: String!) {\n    workflowEventListener(project_id: $projectID) {\n      workflow_id\n      workflow_name\n      workflow_run_id\n      execution_data\n      project_id\n      cluster_name\n      last_updated\n    }\n  }\n`;\n```\n\nWhen Apollo Client executes the `workflowEvents` subscription, it establishes a connection to our GraphQL server and listens for response data. Unlike a query, there is no expectation that the server will immediately process and return a response. Instead, our server only pushes data to the client when a particular event occurs on your backend (In our case, a new workflow is scheduled/ran).\n\n---\n\n## Executing a Subscriber\n\nApollo provides us with different hooks like `useQuery`, `useSubscription`, etc to make our life easier when executing queries from a GraphQL server. We'll be executing a subscription we defined earlier to listen to the event and keep our frontend updated with any data changes from the backend once we are subscribed to that particular workflow.\n\nWhenever a query returns a result in Apollo Client, that result includes a `subscribeToMore` function. You can use this function to execute a followup subscription that pushes updates to the query's original result.\n\n```\nconst { subscribeToMore, data, error } = useQuery(\n    WORKFLOW_DETAILS,\n    {\n      variables: { projectID: selectedProjectID },\n      fetchPolicy: 'cache-and-network',\n    }\n  );\n\n  // Using subscription to get realtime data\n  \n  subscribeToMore({\n      document: WORKFLOW_EVENTS,\n      variables: { projectID: selectedProjectID },\n      updateQuery: (prev, { subscriptionData }) =\u003e {\n        if (!subscriptionData.data) return prev;\n        const modifiedWorkflows = prev.getWorkFlowRuns.slice();\n        \n        return { ...prev, getWorkFlowRuns: modifiedWorkflows };\n      },\n  });\n\n```\n\nAll this subscription is doing is query the data at the very beginning and then listening to the server for any more updates on the same Workflow Event, if new data is populated the subscriber updates the previous data with the new one.\n\n\u003e The `subscribeToMore` function is similar in structure to the `fetchMore` function that's commonly used for handling pagination. The primary difference is that `fetchMore` executes a followup query, whereas `subscribeToMore` executes a subscription.\n\n---\n\n## Setting up the transport\n\nBecause subscriptions maintain a persistent connection, they can't use the default HTTP transport that Apollo Client uses for queries and mutations. Instead, Apollo Client subscriptions most commonly communicate over WebSocket, via the community-maintained `subscriptions-transport-ws` library.\n\nWe'd require `subscriptions-transport-ws` since it handles GraphQL WebSocket server and client to facilitate GraphQL queries, mutations and subscriptions over WebSocket behind the hood, other than that we'd require the `@apollo/client` library which can basically handle all your apollo related tasks quite smoothly and it also eliminates the chance of having version collision when trying out hooks/features from other community-driven libraries.\n\n```\nnpm install @apollo/client subscriptions-transport-ws\n```\n\nImport and initialize a `WebSocketLink` object in the same project file where you initialize `ApolloClient`\n\n```bash\nimport { WebSocketLink } from '@apollo/client/link/ws';\n\nconst wsLink = new WebSocketLink({\n  uri: `ws:\u003cGraphQL Endpoint\u003e`,\n  options: {\n    reconnect: true,\n    lazy: true\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn our project, our use case allows us to handle both HTTP as well as WebSocket requests thus our Client Root looks a bit different.\n\n```bash\nimport {\n  ApolloClient,\n  ApolloProvider,\n  HttpLink,\n  InMemoryCache,\n  split,\n} from '@apollo/client';\nimport { setContext } from '@apollo/client/link/context';\nimport { WebSocketLink } from '@apollo/client/link/ws';\nimport { getMainDefinition } from '@apollo/client/utilities';\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux';\nimport { PersistGate } from 'redux-persist/integration/react';\nimport config from './config'; // Stores the GraphQL Configuration\nimport App from './containers/app/App';\nimport configureStore from './redux/configureStore';\nimport getToken from './utils/getToken';\n\nconst { persistor, store } = configureStore();\n\n// HTTP Link\nconst httpLink = new HttpLink({\n  uri: `${config.grahqlEndpoint}/query`,\n});\n\n// Adds Authentication Headers on HTTP as well as was requests\nconst authLink = setContext((_, { headers }) =\u003e {\n  const token = getToken();\n  return {\n    headers: {\n      ...headers,\n      authorization: token,\n    },\n  };\n});\n\n// WebSocket Link\nconst wsLink = new WebSocketLink({\n  uri: `${config.grahqlEndpointSubscription}/query`,\n  options: {\n    reconnect: true,\n    lazy: true,\n  },\n});\n\n// Send query request based on the type definition\nconst link = split(\n  ({ query }) =\u003e {\n    const definition = getMainDefinition(query);\n    return (\n      definition.kind === 'OperationDefinition' \u0026\u0026\n      definition.operation === 'subscription'\n    );\n  },\n  authLink.concat(wsLink),\n  authLink.concat(httpLink)\n);\n\n// Apollo Client\nexport const client = new ApolloClient({\n  link,\n  cache: new InMemoryCache(),\n});\n\nconst ReduxRoot = () =\u003e {\n  return (\n    \u003cApolloProvider client={client}\u003e\n      \u003cProvider store={store}\u003e\n        \u003cPersistGate persistor={persistor}\u003e\n          \u003cApp /\u003e\n        \u003c/PersistGate\u003e\n      \u003c/Provider\u003e\n    \u003c/ApolloProvider\u003e\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ReduxRoot;\n```\n\nUsing this logic, queries and mutations will use HTTP as normal, and subscriptions will use WebSocket.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYou can of-course extend these configurations and play around to create something out of your own.

Dart's [Future](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.9.2/dart-async/Future-class.html) provides a very smooth experience when it comes to handling I/O without worrying about threads or deadlocks.\n\n\u003e A Future is used to represent a potential value, or error, that will be available at some time in the future. \n\nReceivers of a Future can register callbacks that handle the value or error once it is available.\n\n![Future](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi0.wp.com%2Fthinkdiff.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F08%2FFlutter-_-Dart-3.jpg%3Ffit%3D1200%252C675%26ssl%3D1\u0026f=1\u0026nofb=1)\n\n---\n\n# **Why FutureBuilder is required!**\n\nSuppose you want to return a widget in the `build` method but the data required in the widget comes from an `async` function.\n\n```bash\nclass MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(context) {\n    yourAsyncFetch().then((data) {\n      return ...yourStuff(with the data);\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\nProvided that the fetch could be an HTTP call, a call to SQLite or any call in general that returns a `Future`, this approach won't really work out.\n\nBecause a Widget's `build` method is **synchronous** and it won't wait while you fetch data.\n\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/2zdnl4CB3OygOHe1kX/giphy.gif\" width=\"300\" /\u003e\n\nThis is where **FutureBuilder** (`FutureBuilder\u003cT\u003e`) comes into the picture.\n\n---\n\n# **The Fix**\n\nA `FutureBuilder` takes a Future as an argument, as well as a builder (A delegate called by the widget's build method). The builder will be called immediately, and again when our future resolves with either data or an error.\n\nA `Future` must not be created during `build` when constructing the `FutureBuilder`. If the future is created at the same time as the `FutureBuilder`, then every time the `FutureBuilder`'s parent is rebuilt, the asynchronous task will be restarted.\n\nAn `AsyncSnapshot\u003cT\u003e` is simply a representation of that data/error state.\n\n```bash\nFuture\u003cString\u003e yourAsyncFetch() =\u003e Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3), () =\u003e \"Text coming after 3 seconds\");\n\nclass MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(context) {\n    return FutureBuilder\u003cString\u003e(\n      future: yourAsyncFetch(),\n      builder: (context, AsyncSnapshot\u003cString\u003e snapshot) {\n        if (snapshot.hasData) {\n          return Text(snapshot.data); // Display the data from yourAsyncFetch() function after 3 seconds\n        } else {\n          return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Display a Circular Progress Indicator if the data is not fetched\n        }\n      }\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Voila! Problem Solved.**\n\n---\n\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsi.wsj.net%2Fpublic%2Fresources%2Fimages%2FBN-TS039_fundpe_TOP_20170602140435.jpg\u0026f=1\u0026nofb=1\" width=\"300\" /\u003e\n\n# **Effect on Performance**\n\nFutureBuilder is just a `StatefulWidget` whose `state` is a **_snapshot**. It's initial state is `_snapshot = AsyncSnapshot\u003cT\u003e.withData(ConnectionState.none, widget.initialData);`\n\nIt subscribes to a future which we send and updates the state based on that.\n\n```bash\nwidget.future.then\u003cvoid\u003e((T data) {\n    if (_activeCallbackIdentity == callbackIdentity) {\n       setState(() {\n          _snapshot = AsyncSnapshot\u003cT\u003e.withData(ConnectionState.done, data);\n       });\n    }\n}, onError: (Object error) {\n    if (_activeCallbackIdentity == callbackIdentity) {\n       setState(() {\n          _snapshot = AsyncSnapshot\u003cT\u003e.withError(ConnectionState.done, error);\n       });\n    }\n});\n```\n\nThus the `FutureBuilder` is just a wrapper of what we normally do, so there is no impact on the performance.\n\n---\n\n![Thank You](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.confidencecoach.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F03%2FWhite-Sticky-Note-With-Thank-You-Message-And-Red-Push-Pin-On-Yellow-Background-941674606_841x421.jpeg\u0026f=1\u0026nofb=1)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThat's all folks 👨‍🏫, Thank you for reading it till the end.

One of the best ways to check for code integrity is setting up a linter such as **ESLint**\n\n# **What is ESLint?**\n\n![Eslint](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmichelenasti.com%2Fimages%2Feslint.png\u0026f=1\u0026nofb=1)\n\n[**ESLint**](https://eslint.org/) is an open source project that helps developers find and fix problems with their JavaScript code. It's the number one JavaScript linter by downloads on npm (over 6.5 million downloads per week) and is used at companies like Microsoft, Airbnb, Netflix, and Facebook. Due to ESLint's flexibility, it's also able to help find and fix problems in JavaScript derivative languages such as [Flow](https://flow.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), as well as for mobile development with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).\n\nRules in ESLint are configurable, and customized rules can be defined and loaded. ESLint covers both code quality and coding style issues.\n\n---\n\n# **Architecture**\n\n![ESLint Architecture](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/architecture/dependency.svg)\nTaking a high level look at ESLint we are going to discuss a few important key parts which would be very useful to understand the inner core components which can be configured to achieve more with ESLint.\n\n**eslint.js** is a dumb component that does nothing more than bootstraping ESLint and passing the command line arguments to the CLI(**cli.js**). It does not require much heavy lifting and thus is pretty small.\n\n**api.js** is the main entry point of `require` command. It exposes an object that contains public classes to Linter, CLIEngine, RuleTester and Source Code.\n\n**init** module contains the `--init` functionality that sets up the configuration for a end user.\n\n**cli.js** takes an array of arguments and then uses `eslint` to execute the commands.\n\n**cli-engine** module consists of `CLIEngine` class that is responsible to figure out the configuration files and then verify code using `Linter`.\n\n**linter** does code verification based on the configurations provided. It does not interact with the console at all.\n\nLearn more at the [official docs](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/architecture)\n\n---\n\n#### **CLI Engine**\n\nIt reads both configuration and source files(including `eslintrc` and `package.json`) as well as manages the environment that is passed into the Linter object.\n\nThe main method of the CLIEngine is `executeOnFiles()`, which accepts an array of file and directory names to run the linter on.\n\nIt does not use formatters or outputs to the console. The operation is not asynchronous as well.\n\n#### **Linter**\n\nThe main method of the Linter object is `verify()` and accepts two arguments: the source text to verify and a configuration object. First the given text is parsed using a parser(which you decide, some common parsers are _espree_, _typescript-eslint-parser_, etc) and it generates back an AST(Abstract Syntax Tree).\n\nThe AST is produced with both line/column and range locations which are useful for reporting location of issues and retrieving the source text related to an AST node, respectively. The AST is then traversed from top to bottom.\n\nAt each node, the Linter object emits an event that has the same name as the node type (i.e., \"Identifier\", \"WithStatement\", etc.). On the way back up the subtree, an event is emitted with the AST type name and suffixed with \":exit\", such as \"Identifier:exit\" - this allows rules to take action both on the way down and on the way up in the traversal. \n\n---\n\nIn this blog I'll be talking about the eslint configuration we use in Litmus. \n\n![Litmus](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jU91rNXg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9a1qur50nxb8hlp8w0nk.png)\n\nLitmus is a framework for practicing chaos engineering in [cloud-native environments](https://dev.to/umamukkara/chaos-engineering-for-cloud-native-systems-2fjn). Litmus provides a chaos operator, a large set of chaos experiments on its [hub](https://hub.litmuschaos.io/), detailed [documentation](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/), and a friendly [community](https://litmuschaos.io/). Litmus is very easy to use; you can also set up a very [quick demo environment](https://dev.to/uditgaurav/get-started-with-litmuschaos-in-minutes-4ke1) to install and run Litmus experiments.\n\nIf you don't already have a typescript project created you can do so by generating a boilerplate basic setup, for example this is how you can get up and running with a base react-typescript setup, similar to what we have with Litmus\n```\nnpx create-react-app your-app --template typescript\n```\n\n# **Setting up the Project**\n\nThe first thing that needs to be done is to install eslint and eslint-plugin-import in your project directory to be able to initialise our project with eslint configurations  and also add on further configurations later.\n\n```\nnpm install eslint eslint-plugin-import --save-dev\n```\nOnce the package is installed we can use it to initialize an ESLint configuration by running \n```\neslint --init\n```\nSoon you would be prompted in an interactive CLI to choose your style guide, framework, etc following which eslint will create a `.eslintrc` file for you with those configurations but we are not going to follow that.\n\n![Interactive CLI](https://scotch-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1564425552/cubil4tc2ra35g4avhvk.png)\n\nInstead we are going to create our own `eslintrc` file with our custom configurations.\n\n---\n\n# **Pre-requisites**\n\nIn order to create a set of amazing custom linting rules we would require some packages which would help us get the work done in a lot less time. \n\nFirst things first, you need to make sure you already have `typescript` installed in your project and your project is following a typescript template based setup with a tsconfig file.\n\n\u003eNOTE: You could also use these eslint rules and configurations without typescript but the packages/parsers might be a little different for you \n\nA few dev-dependencies/peer-dependencies that would be required for this particular setup are -\n\n\u003e* eslint-config-airbnb\n\u003e* eslint-config-prettier\n\u003e* eslint-plugin-import\n\u003e* eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y\n\u003e* eslint-plugin-prettier\n\u003e* eslint-plugin-react\n\u003e* eslint-plugin-react-hooks\n\u003e* prettier\n\u003e* @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin\n\u003e* @typescript-eslint/parser\n\nSince writing efficient code and following best practices are a key to achieving quality code we prefer following the [Airbnb style guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/) for cleaner code.\n\nIn order to be able to put them to use in our project we need to install some peer dependencies which need to have an exact version number in order to function properly, let's do that first before jumping into the next one.\n\n```\nnpx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb\n```\n\n\u003eNOTE: In order to use `install-peerdeps` we would require `eslint-plugin-import` which we'd already installed earlier\n\nOnce the style guide and its peer-dependencies are set we also need to add the parsers, eslint-plugin for typescript as well as prettier for eslint to make our linted code check for correct code formatting.\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev  prettier @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier\n```\n\n---\n\n# **Creating our own .eslintrc**\n\nCreate a `.eslintrc.json` file at the root of your project, this is where we would be writing our own configuration for our project.\n\n#### **Parser**\nLet's put the packages we had previously installed to use and assign our eslint a parser.\n```\n\"parser\": \"@typescript-eslint/parser\"\n```\nThis parser would leverage TypeScript ESTree to allow for ESLint to lint TypeScript source code. \n\n---\n\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eskadenia.com%2FPortals%2FPortal1%2FUpload%2FBlock%2FImage%2Fconfiguration-settings.jpg\u0026f=1\u0026nofb=1\" width=\"200\" /\u003e\n\n#### **Extend Configuration**\nSince we are following Airbnb style guide to achieve best practices and cleaner code we need to let our linter know about this. We can extend our linter's configuration in order to extend its functionality\n```\n \"extends\": [\"airbnb\"]\n```\nAlthough eslint formats our code it does not go far enough. The code does not look very nice. This is where the wheat is separated from the chaff. ESLint is primarily intended for code quality. Prettier, as the name implies, makes your code Prettier. With added extensibility of Prettier our linter would let us know when a certain code format is incorrect in term of airbnb style guide and also the set of custom rules.\n```\n  \"extends\": [\"airbnb\", \"plugin:prettier/recommended\", \"prettier/react\"]\n```\n\n---\n\n#### **ESLint Plugin**\nNext we move on to adding the eslint-plugin.\n```\n\"plugins\": [\"@typescript-eslint\"]\n```\nThis eslint plugin provides an already configured list of linting rules which you can use right out of the box. Take a look at the rules [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin). They provide a list of _recommended_ rules which includes `naming-convention`, `no-this-alias`, etc which are very handy.\n\nTo be able to use them in our project we need to add them in `\"rules\"`. Some of the typescript-eslint rules which are extensively used in Litmus are -\n```\n\"rules\": {\n    \"@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars\": \"error\",\n    \"@typescript-eslint/no-useless-constructor\": \"error\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fbocceballpro.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F09%2Frules.jpg\u0026f=1\u0026nofb=1\" width=\"200\" /\u003e\n\n#### **Modifying Rules**\nJust these two rules won't do for a codebase like ours which requires quick a lot of checks to achieve top quality code integrity. So let's add some more. \n```\n\"rules\": {\n    \"jsx-a11y/href-no-hash\": [\"off\"],\n    \"react/jsx-props-no-spreading\": [\"off\"],\n    \"react/jsx-filename-extension\": [\n      \"warn\",\n      { \"extensions\": [\".js\", \".jsx\", \".ts\", \".tsx\"] }\n    ],\n    \"no-console\": [\n      \"error\",\n      {\n        \"allow\": [\"warn\", \"error\"]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"multiline-ternary\": 0,\n    \"no-unused-vars\": \"off\",\n    \"no-shadow\": 0,\n    \"@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars\": \"error\",\n    \"no-useless-constructor\": \"off\",\n    \"@typescript-eslint/no-useless-constructor\": \"error\",\n    \"react/prop-types\": 0,\n    \"import/extensions\": [\n      \"error\",\n      \"ignorePackages\",\n      {\n        \"js\": \"never\",\n        \"jsx\": \"never\",\n        \"ts\": \"never\",\n        \"tsx\": \"never\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"max-len\": [\n      \"warn\",\n      {\n        \"code\": 80,\n        \"tabWidth\": 2,\n        \"comments\": 80,\n        \"ignoreComments\": false,\n        \"ignoreTrailingComments\": true,\n        \"ignoreUrls\": true,\n        \"ignoreStrings\": true,\n        \"ignoreTemplateLiterals\": true,\n        \"ignoreRegExpLiterals\": true\n      }\n    ]\n}\n```\nYou can customise your configuration by modifying the rules section. You will need to input `key -\u003e value` pairs, where the `key` is the name of the rule.\n\nThe values **Error**, **Off**, **Warn** have a specific meaning when it comes to configuring the rules.\n\n“Error” will strictly request you to change the portion of code which does not comply with the rules specified, “Warn” will only provide you a warning but you can still continue with your code, and “Off” would simply not check for that particular rule in your code base.\n\n---\n\n#### **Environments**\n\nTo specify environments in a configuration file, we use the `env` key and specify the environments we want to enable by setting each to true.\n```\n\"env\": {\n    \"browser\": true,\n    \"es6\": true\n}\n```\nHere we are enabling the browser and es6 environments.\n\n\u003eNOTE: `env` is required for global variables. ESLint will enable the globals for the env variables we select.\n\n---\n\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn1.iconfinder.com%2Fdata%2Ficons%2Fflat-web-browser%2F100%2Fsettings-512.png\u0026f=1\u0026nofb=1\" width=\"200\n\" /\u003e\n\n#### **Settings**\n\nModifying the default eslint settings to our own needs\n```\n\"settings\": {\n    \"import/extensions\": [\".js\", \".jsx\", \".ts\", \".tsx\"],\n    \"import/parsers\": {\n      \"@typescript-eslint/parser\": [\".ts\", \".tsx\"]\n    },\n    \"import/resolver\": {\n      \"node\": {\n        \"extensions\": [\".js\", \".jsx\", \".ts\", \".tsx\"]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\nAdding `import/extensions` to support linting of ES2015+ (ES6+) import/export syntax, and prevent issues with misspelling of file paths and import names. \n\nWe also need to import/require files with extension `.ts/.tsx`, Use paths defined in `tsconfig.json` and resolve `@types/*` definitions over plain `.js, .ts`\n\nHere is the whole .eslintrc file at a glance\n\n```\n{\n  \"parser\": \"@typescript-eslint/parser\",\n  \"plugins\": [\"@typescript-eslint\"],\n  \"extends\": [\"airbnb\", \"plugin:prettier/recommended\", \"prettier/react\"],\n  \"env\": {\n    \"browser\": true,\n    \"es6\": true\n  },\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"import/extensions\": [\".js\", \".jsx\", \".ts\", \".tsx\"],\n    \"import/parsers\": {\n      \"@typescript-eslint/parser\": [\".ts\", \".tsx\"]\n    },\n    \"import/resolver\": {\n      \"node\": {\n        \"extensions\": [\".js\", \".jsx\", \".ts\", \".tsx\"]\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"jsx-a11y/href-no-hash\": [\"off\"],\n    \"react/jsx-props-no-spreading\": [\"off\"],\n    \"react/jsx-filename-extension\": [\n      \"warn\",\n      { \"extensions\": [\".js\", \".jsx\", \".ts\", \".tsx\"] }\n    ],\n    \"no-console\": [\n      \"error\",\n      {\n        \"allow\": [\"warn\", \"error\"]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"multiline-ternary\": 0,\n    \"no-unused-vars\": \"off\",\n    \"no-shadow\": 0,\n    \"@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars\": \"error\",\n    \"no-useless-constructor\": \"off\",\n    \"@typescript-eslint/no-useless-constructor\": \"error\",\n    \"react/prop-types\": 0,\n    \"import/extensions\": [\n      \"error\",\n      \"ignorePackages\",\n      {\n        \"js\": \"never\",\n        \"jsx\": \"never\",\n        \"ts\": \"never\",\n        \"tsx\": \"never\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"max-len\": [\n      \"warn\",\n      {\n        \"code\": 80,\n        \"tabWidth\": 2,\n        \"comments\": 80,\n        \"ignoreComments\": false,\n        \"ignoreTrailingComments\": true,\n        \"ignoreUrls\": true,\n        \"ignoreStrings\": true,\n        \"ignoreTemplateLiterals\": true,\n        \"ignoreRegExpLiterals\": true\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\nVoila, you have successfully created an eslint config file which can check for unused variables, unused import statements, extra long comments, etc. You can ofcourse extend these and play around to create something out of your own.

Even for the simplest of applications you might see a pretty long Widget Tree. The Widget tree of the basic counter app which is provided by default in Flutter would look like this(In reality its much bigger than this):\n\n![Widget Tree for Counter App](https://freecontent.manning.com/wp-content/uploads/Windmill_AaFW_01.png)\n\nFlutter widgets are **reactive**. They respond to any new information from an outside source. Consider a Stateful component as a parent to another Stateless component. \n\nIn that case whenever one of the states on which the stateless component was relying on changes, the widget calls `didUpdateWidget` life cycle method and repaints if necessary. For example:\n\n```dart\nIconButton(\n    icon: Icons.add,\n    onPressed: (){\n        setState((){\n            this.value++;\n        })\n    }\n),\nText(\"Value = ${this.value}\")\n```\n\nIn this example the `value` state is a part of Text Widget which is updated every time it receives the onPressed callback from icon button. The button calls the `setState()` method will tells Flutter to repaint the widget which relies on the state change. \n\nFlutter knows that it needs to rebuild because the `IconButton` state is marked `dirty`.\n\n## Let's look at this in a stepwise manner 🧗\n1. User taps on the **Icon Button**.\n2. Your application calls the `setState` method in the `IconButton.onPressed()` callback.\n3. Flutter realises that it needs to re-build, because the state value inside the has updated which called the `didUpdateWidget` causing the IconButton to be marked as `dirty`.\n4. The new widget replaces the old one in the Widget Tree.\n5. Flutter renders the new tree.\n\n*Now that you know how flutter knows when to render a new widget, let's take a look at how the rendering happens in a series of steps.*\n\n![Flutter Rendering Pipeline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12946491/45251821-45ea4680-b37f-11e8-9d5c-174865c2c857.png)\n# Rendering Pipeline\nThis is a sequence of steps that the Flutter's rendering engine takes when rendering objects. This overview will provide a high-level description of the steps in the pipeline.\n___\n### **Animate**\nFlutter kicks off the rendering process by starting an animation ticker. If an element needs to be repainted, for example, if you are scrolling down a list, in a scenario like this, the starting position of the list is incrementally moved to its ending location in order for it to have a smooth transition.\n\nThis is controlled by animation tickers, which dictate the time that an element has to move. You can therefore control how dramatic the animations are. During an animation, flutter rebuilds and paints every single frame.\n___\n### **Build**\nIn this step Flutter builds and constructs the Widget Tree. The individual configurations of the widgets are taken into consideration here while building the widget tree, rather than the Shape and Size of the Widget.\n\nIt means the data and configuration of how that Widget will look into the screen is taken into count here, it's not actually building a blue box or something like that. Widgets just handle the configuration of what will eventually be painted into the screen.\n___\n### **Layout**\nAfter the Widgets are composed, Flutter starts thinking about layouts. Flutter walks down the tree in a Bottom Up fashion in linear time(If you've done Compiler Design before you might get this part easily).\n\nWhen it walks down the tree, it collects information about the position of the widgets, which was defined in the previous step. *In Flutter, layout and size are dictated from the parent to the child.*\n\n```dart\nWidget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Container(\n        child: Row(\n            children: List\u003cWidget\u003e[\n                IconButton(\n                    icon: Icons.add,\n                    onPressed: () {\n                        setState(() {\n                            this.value++;\n                        });\n                    }),\n                Text(\"Qty: ${this.value}\")                \n            ],\n        )\n    );\n}\n```\nWhat this means is when the `IconButton` is tapped on the `ValueUpdateWidget`(Let's say the name of the widget is `ValueUpdate`) the value state is updated with a new value which is one more than the previous value. Flutter walks down the widget tree and `ValueUpdateWidget` tells the buttons and text fields their constraints.\n\nThen the buttons will tell the widget which represent the addition icons(or the widgets which are further concerned with the parent widget which in this case is the button) their constraints, and it goes on down the tree. Once the algorithm bottoms out at the leaf node widgets, then it knows their size constraints.\n\nOn the way back up they can all safely take up the right amount of space at the correct position.\n___\n### **Paint**\nAfter Flutter gets the exact idea of the widget's constraints and is completely sure that there are no conflicts, it can finally paint all the widgets.\n\n##### *Note: The widgets are not physically painted in the screen.*\n___\n### **Compositing**\nIn this step Flutter gives the actual widget co-ordinates to the screen. Now they know the exact pixel they'll take up. This step is called *compositing*.\n\nFor a good number of reasons this step is kept separate from the painting step. For example, lets consider the use case when you are scrolling through a long list. \n\n![Scrolling Compositing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12946491/45251864-e3de1100-b37f-11e8-8c76-1848c003f494.png)\n\nIn such cases rather than rebuilding your entire list items every time a new one scrolls on or off the screen, Flutter already has them built and painted and can plug them in where they need to go.\n___\n### **Rasterize**\nNow the widgets are ready to go. The engine combines the entire tree into a render-able view and tells the operating system to display it. This is called rasterizing, and it’s the last step.\n___\n![Thank you](https://alleecreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Thank-You1.jpg)\n\nIf you'd like to know more about Flutter renders, [check out this Google Tech Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUfXWzp0-DU).

Eliminating redundant efforts and investing our time to learn the right tools or getting to know about few amazing resources which can greatly help us out.\n\nIn this article we'll look at a few GitHub repositories which can greatly enhance your Web Development skills and also help you write better code.\n\n![Node JS Best Practices Cover](https://i.ibb.co/Lh1ZMvZ/Nodejs-best-prac.jpg)\n# **Node.js Best Practices**\n\nThis repository is an amazing place to keep yourself updated with the Node world and also learn about the best practices while you're at it. With over 40k stars and 133 contributors, this repository gets an update almost every single day. \n\nThis repository is a summary and curation of the top-ranked content on Node.js best practices and also its integration with other tools like Docker, Kubernetes, etc. It currently has more than 80 best practices, style guides, and architectural tips. \n\nSome common best practices includes -\n* Structuring your Projects better\n* Error Handling Practices\n* Code Style Practices\n* Testing And Overall Quality Practices\n* Going To Production Practices\nand so much more.\n\nCheck out this repo [here](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices)\n\n![HTML5 Boilerplate Cover](https://i.ibb.co/ZfndTw4/HTMl5-Boiler.jpg)\n# **HTML5 Boilerplate**\n\nHTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end template for building fast, robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.\n\nThis project is the product of years of iterative development and community knowledge. It does not impose a specific development philosophy or framework, so you're free to architect your code in the way that you want.\n\nIt includes predefined features like -\n* Normalize.css\n* jQuery with CDN\n* Apache Server Configs\n* Useful CSS helper classes\n* Default print styles, performance optimized and more\n\nDepending on what you want to use and how you want to use it, you may have to copy and paste the contents of that folder into your project directory. Thus giving you a already pre-configured starter template to speed up your development time.\n\nCheck out this repo [here](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)\n\n![RealWorld Cover](https://i.ibb.co/4Krzzr7/REal-World.jpg)\n# **RealWorld**\n\nMastering the core concepts \u0026 ideology of a new framework is unnecessarily frustrating.\n\nFrom reading the docs 📃, running a contrived example in a codepen, ripping apart example apps \u0026 put it back together again to getting their CLI installed locally, its just too much work and in the if you do not get the concept right! Its equally frustrating.\n\n**RealWorld** allows you to choose any frontend (React, Angular 2, \u0026 more) and any backend (Node, Django, \u0026 more) and integrate them both to see a real world example of the application. \n\nSince these implementations are responsible for the entire stack, they obviously cannot be mixed and matched but they still adhere to the same functionality \u0026 UX specs.\n\nFew Popular Integrations -\n* Angular + ngrx + nx\n* ClojureScript + re-frame\n* React / MobX\n* Go + Gin\n* NestJS + TypeORM/Prisma\n\nAnd you can find tons more in the original repository. Have fun checking them out!\n\nNot just for the Web but the cool thing is they are available for Mobile as well in the form of **NativeScript**.\n\nReact Native, Jasonette, Swift, C# on Xamarin, Kotlin/Android, Onymos, Quasar framework, Swift Perfect and Flutter are still a *work in progress*.\n\nCheck out the repo [here](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)\n\n![You Don't Know JS Yet Cover](https://i.ibb.co/r5m5Qfv/You-Dont-Know.jpg)\n# **You Don't Know JS Yet**\n\nThis is a series of books diving deep into the core mechanisms of the JavaScript language.\n\nAll the books are complete free of charge and you can read them online on the repository. \n\nThe recommended order of reading the book by the author is -\n* Get Started\n* Scope \u0026 Closures\n* Objects \u0026 Classes (Work in Progress)\n* Types \u0026 Grammar (Work in Progress)\n* Sync \u0026 Async (Work in Progress)\n* ES.Next \u0026 Beyond (Work in Progress)\n\nCheck out this repo [here](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)\n\n![Airbnb JavaScript Guide Cover](https://i.ibb.co/xSdGPTY/Airbnb-JSGuide.jpg)\n# **Airbnb JavaScript Guide**\n\nThis is an extremely precise and professional style guide by Airbnb. \n\nThis guide will help you understand JavaScript from the inside out by going deeper into fundamentals along with code snippets to help you along the way.\n\nSome popular topics this style guide touches upon are -\n* Arrow Functions\n* Hoisting\n* Type Casting \u0026 Coercion\n* ECMAScript 6+ (ES 2015+) Styles\n* Testing\n* Performance\n\nCheck out the repo [here](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)\n\n![Storybook Cover](https://i.ibb.co/cFWn033/Storybook.jpg)\n# **Storybook**\n\nStorybook 📖 is a development environment for UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components.\n\nStorybook runs outside of your app. This allows you to develop UI components in isolation, which can improve component reuse, testability, and development speed. You can build quickly without having to worry about application-specific dependencies.\n\nIt comes together with a CLI and some code examples for you to get accustomed with Storybook.\n\nCheck out the repo [here](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook)\n\n![Front End Checklist Cover](https://i.ibb.co/KGMsvHk/front-end-checklist.jpg)\n# **Front-End-Checklist**\n\nThe Front-End Checklist is an exhaustive list of all elements you need to have or to test before launching your website or HTML page to production.\n\nIt is a repository which is based on Front End Web Development and focuses more on performance, security, SEO, etc. All items in the Front-End Checklist are required for the majority of the projects, but some elements can be omitted or are not essential.\n\nIt contains -\n📖: documentation or article\n🛠: online tool / testing tool\n📹: media or video content\n\nCheck out this repo [here](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist)\n\n# Inspiration and Resources\n\nThis article was inspired by [Tech Sapien](https://www.instagram.com/tech.sapien/) and all his amazing work\n🔥. The repository pictures 📷 are also taken from the same.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThat's all folks 👨‍🏫, Thank you for making it this far down. All the repositories mentioned are not just the only resources available, I'm sure there must be tons of other amazing project out there too. These are the ones that I really found helpful and often get myself indulged into. 👨🏻‍💻\n\nDon't forget to *star* 🌟 these repositories as a *thank you* note for all the amazing contributors who put their effort creating these amazing resources for all of us.
